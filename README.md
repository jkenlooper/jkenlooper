### Web Developer

I seem to enjoy building tools and hacking on personal projects that use those
tools. I've built a few things in the past and some of those I actually try to
maintain.

### Other Projects I Work On

Most git projects that I have started and continue to maintain have moved to
[sourcehut]: <https://git.sr.ht/~jkenlooper/>.

Some have moved to [Codeberg]: <https://codeberg.org/jkenlooper>

Most of the remaining active projects that I maintain in GitHub will eventually
move. I no longer like the direction that GitHub is taking and prefer working
with alternate git hosting websites like [sourcehut] and [Codeberg]. See the
[Give Up GitHub!](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) article for more
information on my reason to no longer host most of my projects on GitHub.

### Puzzle Massive

The major project I started in 2011 is [Puzzle Massive].  Version 2 of this
project will stay on GitHub. It benefits from the visibility of being on GitHub
and within the related GitHub topics. The _rewrite_ of Puzzle Massive (version
3) is hosted at <https://git.sr.ht/~jkenlooper/puzzle-massive>.

I am starting a new version 3 of Puzzle Massive which will not be compatible
with version 2. It is mostly a rewrite; and yes, rewrites are generally a _bad_
idea. This one, however, is justified because I don't have to keep the previous
version running or maintained.

The other projects that are directly jigsaw puzzle related ([piecemaker],
[pixsaw]) will stay on GitHub and are not being rewritten. They would also
largely become invisible to potential contributors if they were not on GitHub at
this time.
