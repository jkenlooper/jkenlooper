## Web Developer

I'm a Web Developer that takes pride in creatively solving problems when it
comes down to anything software related. I have learned the benefits of some
frameworks versus others, and how well they do when it comes to maintaining
websites that use them. With this experience, I have gained a few opinions on
the current trend of front-end web development and have kept up with frameworks
that are widely used.

My focus is mostly on building websites that are accessible, maintainable, and
cost-effective. Websites that I've built commonly use Python web frameworks,
databases, message queuing, and integrate with third-party services. I stay up
to date with the latest best practices when it comes to security and regularly
update dependencies and keep an eye out for vulnerabilities.

I have worked on software projects ranging from shell scripts, infrastructure
and build pipeline automation, Python applications, and websites that require
authentication and fine-grained authorization. As a Fullstack Software Engineer
I know how to deploy and maintain infrastructure on various cloud hosting
services, design graphics and user interfaces, manage data and ensure backup and
recovery strategies are in place, and I try to keep my CSS skills sharp among
all the endless things one needs to know in this field.

All of my open source projects on GitHub, [Codeberg], and [sourcehut] are built
because I had a problem I wanted to solve. I like creating and solving problems,
which is probably why I enjoy programming.

## Puzzle Massive - Online Jigsaw Puzzles

My longest running side project is Puzzle Massive. It's currently at version
3 and it's what I look forward to hacking on during my spare time. More details
about the Puzzle Massive project are at my site:
[https://massive.xyz/puzzle](https://massive.xyz/puzzle). I have also developed
an open source tool to generate jigsaw puzzle pieces called [piecemaker] which
Puzzle Massive uses.
