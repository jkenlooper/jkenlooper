### Web Developer

I seem to enjoy building tools and hacking on personal projects that use those
tools. I've built a few things in the past and some of those I actually try to
maintain.

### Other Projects I Work On

Most git projects that I have started and continue to maintain have moved to
[sourcehut]: <https://git.sr.ht/~jkenlooper/>.

Some have moved to [Codeberg]: <https://codeberg.org/jkenlooper>

Most of the remaining active projects that I maintain in GitHub will eventually
move. I no longer like the direction that GitHub is taking and prefer working
with alternate git hosting websites like [sourcehut] and [Codeberg]. See the
[Give Up GitHub!](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) article for more
information on my reason to no longer host most of my projects on GitHub.

### Puzzle Massive

The major project I started is [Puzzle Massive](https://puzzle.massive.xyz/). It
has not been actively maintained and is a bit of a mess at the moment. I am
mostly just cleaning it up in preparation of starting a new version of it and
hosting that in [Codeberg]. For now, it will remain in GitHub land until
I archive it.
