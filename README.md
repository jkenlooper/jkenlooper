## Web Developer

Hi, I'm a web developer with quite a few years of experience in a wide range of
technologies. I have worked with companies to help them update older
applications and services and transition to different infrastructure. I've
worked with teams to design and implement custom software solutions within
reasonable time frames. At my current job, I'm able to continue building tools
and services for a larger organization and enable software engineering teams to
get stuff done.

I started my current Software Engineer career as a self-taught Web Developer
that ran a few websites for friends. Building websites and programming in Python
was, and still is, a hobby of mine that I enjoy doing. All of my open source
projects on GitHub, [Codeberg], and [sourcehut] are built because I had
a problem I wanted to solve. I like creating and solving problems, which is
probably why I enjoy programming.

## Puzzle Massive - Online Jigsaw Puzzles

My longest running side project is Puzzle Massive. It's currently at version
3 and it's what I look forward to hacking on during my spare time. More details
about the Puzzle Massive project are at my site:
[https://massive.xyz/puzzle](https://massive.xyz/puzzle). I have also developed
an open source tool to generate jigsaw puzzle pieces called [piecemaker] which
Puzzle Massive uses.
